Physician reimbursements continue to be squeezed. Facilities are consuming more of our healthcare dollars. Prices for the same exact service vary significantly but no one – neither consumers nor physicians – knows it. And, consumers are bearing more financial responsibility but don’t have the tools to handle it effectively.<br/>HealthEngine is here to change all of that.<br/>","HealthEngine has created a dynamic marketplace for healthcare services where consumers and physicians win. We believe:<br/>Consumers should be able to shop<br/>for high quality healthcare services the same way they do for everything else that matters to them.<br/>Physicians should be able to effectively communicate value in a dynamic market.<br/>Prices (rates negotiated by health plans) should be dynamic instead of staying unchanged and uncompetitive for years on end.<br/>We don’t accept these limitations in any other part of our lives.
