Physician reimbursements continue to be squeezed. Facilities are consuming more of our healthcare dollars. Prices for the same exact service vary significantly but no one – neither consumers nor physicians – knows it. And, consumers are bearing more financial responsibility but don’t have the tools to handle it effectively.HealthEngine is here to change all of that.]]></page><page Index="3" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[HealthEngine has created a dynamic marketplace for healthcare services where consumers and physicians win. We believe:Consumers should be able to shopfor high quality healthcare services the same way they do for everything else that matters to them.Physicians should be able to effectively communicate value in a dynamic market.Prices (rates negotiated by health plans) should be dynamic instead of staying unchanged and uncompetitive for years on end.We don’t accept these limitations in any other part of our lives. With HealthEngine we don’t have to in healthcare either.]]></page><page Index="4" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[According to a recent report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation:From 2013 through 2014, patients’ share of their (healthcare) costs grew by 9.5% for established patients and by 7.9% for new patients.]]></page><page Index="5" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[HealthEngine’s platform has three parts:12Our HealthEngine Care Concierge team partners with consumers asthey navigate the healthcare system.
